# DIVCOW Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction

DIVCOW presents a new form of token ecosystem through the innovative convergence of gaming, advertising, and blockchain technology. This project aims to create a virtuous cycle of user participation and token value appreciation based on the TON blockchain.

Theoretical Interpretation

The theoretical interpretation of DIVCOW is based on the following core concepts:

### 1) Decentralized Value Creation and Distribution

Unlike centralized platforms, DIVCOW builds a system that directly returns the value created by users to the users themselves. By transparently distributing the revenue generated through game participation and ad viewing, it optimizes the value exchange between the platform and users.

### 2) Utilization of Token Economics

DIVCOW tokens function as an incentive mechanism within the ecosystem, beyond being a simple means of transaction. Through methods such as airdrops, burns, and staking, it maintains and increases the value of tokens while promoting user participation.

### 3) Maximization of Network Effects

As user participation increases, advertising revenue grows, which in turn leads to more rewards for users. This virtuous cycle structure continuously enhances the value of the network.

### 4) Utilization of Blockchain Technology

By leveraging the high-speed, low-cost characteristics of the TON blockchain, real-time transactions and reward distributions are made possible. This improves user experience and increases system efficiency.

### 5) Encouraging Participation through Gamification

Through ranking systems and reward structures, continuous user participation is encouraged. This leads to community formation and increased platform loyalty beyond simple rewards.

Based on these theoretical foundations, DIVCOW aims to overcome the limitations of existing centralized platforms and present a new user-centric value creation model. This reflects the new paradigm of the Web3 era and is an innovative approach leading the future of the digital economy.

## 2. DIVCOW Created Together with the DAO Community

DIVCOW adopts a unique DAO structure where gamers and WEB3 users participate together to enhance the project's value. This provides community members with the opportunity to evolve from mere users to co-creators of the project.

### 2.1 DAO Structure and Participation Method

The DIVCOW DAO is a structure where token holders directly participate in voting on major project decisions. Users can participate in the DAO by purchasing DIVCOW tokens or participating in games.

### 2.2 Roles of the DAO Community

- Proposing and voting on game development directions
- Participating in token economy policy decisions
- Supporting marketing strategy development and execution
- Proposing and evaluating new partnerships

### 2.3 DAO Community Token Allocation

30% of the total token supply is allocated to the DAO community, which can help promote community participation and strengthen the project's long-term development and decentralization.

### 2.4 Coin Value Appreciation Structure Created with the DAO

DIVCOW aims to increase coin value together with the DAO community in the following ways:

- **Game Participation Rewards:** Providing additional token rewards based on DAO members' game participation levels
- **Content Creator Support:** Token rewards for game-related content created by community members
- **Ecosystem Expansion Contribution:** Providing incentives for attracting new partnerships or proposing marketing ideas
- **Token Burning Mechanism:** Aiming for value appreciation through regular token burns decided by DAO voting

## 3. DAO Participation Incentive Structure

### 3.1 DAO Participation Incentive Structure

DIVCOW encourages DAO participation through the following incentives:

- Distribution of DIVCOW platform advertising revenue based on DAO governance participation.
- Distribution of the platform's game advertising revenue to DAO participants as 'ecosystem contribution rewards' in the form of DAO token allocation
- Providing airdrops and DAO participation tokens to skill-based game rankers. This can help promote user participation and activate the ecosystem.

### 3.2 Advertising Revenue Distribution Mechanism

Advertising revenue is distributed as follows:

- User Rewards: 30%
- DAO Community Contribution Rewards: 40%
- DIVCOW Token Burning: 20%
- Infrastructure and Operating Costs: 10%

Through this structure, DIVCOW aims to build an ecosystem where gamers and WEB3 users proactively increase the project's value. Collaboration with the DAO community will be key to DIVCOW's sustainable growth and innovation.

### 3.3 Distribution of Advertising Revenue through DAO Smart Contracts

In the DIVCOW project, TON-based tokens are created and 40% of advertising revenue is allocated to DAOs in the form of tokens. This distribution process can be automated through TON's smart contracts.

### 3.4 Distribution of Advertising Revenue through Smart Contracts

4.1 Distribution of Advertising Revenue through Smart Contracts

Using TON's smart contracts (programs), advertising revenue can be automatically distributed to DAOs as follows:

- **Revenue Aggregation:** Aggregate advertising revenue into a specific account
- **Distribution Logic Implementation:** Implement logic to calculate revenue based on each DAO's share or contribution
- **Token Transfer:** Automatically transfer the calculated amount of DIVCOW tokens to each connected user wallet
- **Transaction Recording:** Transparently record all distribution details on the blockchain
- **Transparency:** Provide an interface to easily verify all distribution processes and results

### 

Through this approach, the DIVCOW project can achieve transparent and efficient distribution of advertising revenue, which will contribute to increasing the project's credibility and participation.

### 3.5 DAO Operation Method

DIVCOW's DAO operation method applies cliff periods and lock-up periods reflecting the latest trends. This contributes to encouraging long-term participation and increasing the stability of token value.

### Cliff Period and Lock-up Period

- **Cliff Period:** DAO participants have a 6-month cliff period. During this period, tokens are locked and cannot be sold or transferred.
- **Lock-up Period:** After the cliff period, tokens are gradually released over 18 months. 1/18 of the total allocation is released monthly.

### Participant Classification and Reward System

- **DAO Participant Rewards:** Holders participating in the DAO community have a lock-up period (24 months) and receive an additional reward of 24% annual interest for staking.

### DAO Governance Participation

Even during the cliff period, DAO members can participate in governance voting. This helps to encourage active community participation from the beginning and jointly determine the direction of the project.

### Incentive Structure

- **Long-term Holder Rewards:** Participants who fully complete the lock-up period are given additional token rewards.
- **Activity-based Rewards:** Additional token rewards are provided for active participation in the DAO (submitting proposals, participating in discussions, etc.).

Through this operation method, DIVCOW can build a stable and sustainable DAO community and induce long-term interest and contribution from participants.

## 4. Market Analysis

GameFi and the advertising market have been showing rapid growth recently. With the advancement of Web3 technology, the popularity of blockchain-based games is increasing, which is creating new forms of advertising models. DIVCOW aims to address the following issues by reflecting these market trends:

- High entry barriers of existing GameFi projects
- Opaque distribution of advertising revenue
- Lack of user participation motivation

DIVCOW innovatively solves these issues by utilizing a Telegram bot. Initially, it encourages Web3 users' participation by allowing easy access through the Telegram bot without app downloads. By using games as universal content, it provides services to users worldwide and increases user participation motivation through a skill-based airdrop reward system.

Currently, the number of Web3 game users is continuously increasing, reaching about X million as of 2024. Industry experts predict that this figure will increase by more than Y times within the next 5 years. As DIVCOW's user pool expands, it will be possible to establish partnerships with major game developers. This will enrich DIVCOW's game ecosystem and accelerate the application of Web3 technology in the gaming industry.

In conclusion, DIVCOW will present a new paradigm in the GameFi and advertising market by accurately grasping current market trends and providing innovative solutions. This will provide users with better gaming experiences and rewards while offering advertisers an effective marketing channel.

### 4.1 Advertising Revenue Market Analysis

The market analysis results based on DIVCOW's advertising revenue model are as follows:

| Daily Active Users | Monthly Advertising Revenue (Estimated) | DAO Distribution Amount (40%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 million | $3,000,000 | $1,200,000 |
| 5 million | $15,000,000 | $6,000,000 |
| 10 million | $30,000,000 | $12,000,000 |

This analysis is based on the assumption that each user views an average of 10 ads per day. Actual revenue may vary depending on advertising unit prices, user engagement, regional advertising market conditions, etc.

As the DIVCOW platform grows, the advertising revenue distributed to the DAO community is expected to increase proportionally. This provides continuous and stable income to DAO participants and forms a structure where the growth of the platform and the development of the DAO create mutual synergy.

This revenue model supports the sustainable growth of the DIVCOW ecosystem and encourages active participation and contribution by providing tangible economic benefits to DAO participants. Additionally, as the user base expands, increased interest from advertisers could lead to higher advertising unit prices, potentially resulting in higher revenues in the long term.
